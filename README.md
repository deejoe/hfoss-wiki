# hfoss-wiki

This is a throwaway README.md file I am 

[ ] creating as @deejoe. I'll then 
[ ] generate a PR against the ritjoe/hfoss-wiki upstream. As @ritjoe I will 
[ ] merge the PR. Then, I'll delete the ritjoe/hfoss-wiki upstream so that 
[ ] I can see what sort of Github-specific holes remain in the downstream clone (aka, Github "fork").

This should make @deejoe a contributor to the project. I'll be looking to see what if any notifications are generated by the deletion.

One of the downsides to the artificial scarcity inherent in this sort of forge approach is that opportunities to create cheap, ephemeral role accounts as exploratory tools is limited by company policy.
